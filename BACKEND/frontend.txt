The system flow works as follows:

When a user accesses the app, they can log in using either their mobile number or email.

After logging in, they are redirected to the homepage, where normal internship listings are visible.

To apply for an internship, the user must complete an application form.

If the user chooses to upload a CV instead of filling in the form manually:

The CV is uploaded to a Supabase container.

A file link is generated and sent to the backend.

The backend performs OCR on the CV and returns a JSON file.

The extracted data is used to pre-fill placeholders in the form, while any missing details can be entered manually by the user.

Once the form is completed, it is saved in a Supabase table directly from Next.js.

After saving, an embedding is generated for the user by calling the update embedding API in the backend.

Once this process is complete, the user can view:

Normal internships (general listings).

Recommended internships, which are personalized.

For recommendations, the frontend sends a GET request to the backend with the user ID.

The backend runs a recommendation program and returns a JSON file containing suggested internships.

The frontend then displays these results.

Additionally, the frontend uses Next i18n to support all Indian languages in the portal.
